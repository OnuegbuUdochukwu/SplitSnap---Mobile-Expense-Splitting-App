            :warning: Bottom Navigation Integrity check failed

            Hi! The automated bottom-navigation integrity check found a problem with the app's tab layout in this branch. Per the project's UI rule, the bottom navigation must contain exactly these four tabs in this order:

            1. Home (index)
            2. Groups (groups)
            3. Activity (activity)
            4. Profile (profile)

            The CI check enforces titles and icon components too. Please update `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to match the required structure and re-run the checks. If you believe this is a false positive, reply here with details and I'll help investigate.

            Helpful commands (run locally):
            ```bash
            npm run check:nav
            ```

            Thanks â€” keeping navigation stable helps preserve UX consistency across releases.
